## Reference Implementation

The high level architecture described was implemented in a real scenario with 40 sessions, where data was collected from different teams.

The implementation diagrama describes how each componente of the architecture was used to automatically generate the MMLA Interfaces.

# Observation tool:

A, K and Observations was developed using a nodejs Express framework and Angular as front end. The source code for this repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Teamwork-Analytics/obs-rules).

# Multimodal data collection

The multimodal data collection for our implementation consist of different applications, one per modality. The Reference Implementation presented here will explain how the indoor positioning data was collected and store. In [this repository](https://github.com/Teamwork-Analytics/MultimodalData) you will find all the scripts that we use for the reference implementation.

- Data Collection/Storage (scripts)

A. Java script
B. Python script

- Data Pre-procesing

A. Python implementation

Please keep in touch if you have intered in developing or contributing to create other applications for other modalities.

# Multimodal modelling

- A set of techniques was develop to automatically generate bar charts, ego-networks and full-social networks. 

# Data Visualisation

# Layered Storytelling
