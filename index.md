## Welcome to the yarn-sense project for Teamwork Analytics

This research project aims to provide evidence for teachers and studets to reflect upon their f2f teamwork activity. The code described in this page belongs to a multimodal learning (MMLA) architecture implemented to automatically generate MMLA user-interfaces to support reflection practices.

The architecture for implementing the MMLA solution is described in the reference implementation in:

- In progess. 2022. YARN-Sense: A Conceptual Architecture for Automatically Generating Multimodal Data Storytelling Interfaces for Supporting Team Learning. [in progress]

These are some examples of MMLA interfaces:

### Repositories

This GitHub project explain the code used to generate multimodal leaning analytic interfaces to support teamwork activity. Different data **modalities** are normally collected in an in-the-wild study. Each modality is independientelly pre-processed... Modalities _Audio_ and `Code` text

1. [Obs-tools](https://github.com/Teamwork-Analytics/obs-rules) repo: is the observation tool and UI. With this application; 1) observations can be canptured and 2) different proxemics visualisations (e.g. proxemics ego-networks and full-networks) can also be automatically generated. Modality: _Epistemic, _Actions_
3. [multimodal-audio](https://github.com/Teamwork-Analytics/multimodal-audio) repo: Modality: _Audio_ and _Video_
